## Application Customizations

I store all settings and keyboard shortcuts in the cloud so that I can easily sync settings across computers. To link a new installation to those files, I execute the following commands:

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User
rm settings.json
rm keybindings.json
rm -rf snippets
ln -s ~/GDrive/Documents/Software/VSCode/User/settings.json settings.json
ln -s ~/GDrive/Documents/Software/VSCode/User/keybindings.json keybindings.json
ln -s ~/GDrive/Documents/Software/VSCode/User/snippets snippets
```

### Storing Settings in the Cloud

If you want to mimic my approach, the following will put them in a folder of your choosing:

```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User
cp settings.json ~/path/of/your/choosing
cp keybindings.json ~/path/of/your/choosing
cp -r snippets ~/path/of/your/choosing
```

### Cloud vs. Git

I wrestled with where to store my settings since instinctually, it makes most sense to store them in this repository. However, I am likely to make edits directly within Code and when working on a project/respository separate from this one. Keeping them in the cloud means I don't have to worry about going back to commit changes.

If you want a look at my `settings.json` file, you can view it here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Iy1KVKNW7x8fhzRNgwAA31pllxYtMd8o/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Iy1KVKNW7x8fhzRNgwAA31pllxYtMd8o/view?usp=sharing).

### Themes

I haven't quite settled on what I feel is best in the realm of themes but the following two are worth a look:

* Material Theme
* Slime Theme

I currently have the Slime theme enabled. `Command-K + Command-T` will pop the theme selection window.

## Code Formatting

> The ratio of time spent reading (code) versus writing is well over 10 to 1 â€¦ (therefore) making it easy to read makes it easier to write.
> 
> -Bob Martin, Clean Code

Promoting consistency in code formatting has gotten much easier as development environments has evolved. I 

* CSS: `.css`
* HTML: `.html`
* JavaScript: `.js`
* JSON: `.json`
* PHP: `.php`
* Sass: `.scss`
* Vue.js: `.vue`
* YAML: `.yaml`

VS Code provides a number of tools to ensure code is formatted properly and adheres to modern style guides. However, as far as I can tell, the community has not yet settled on a best practice that facilitates setup within VS Code. Many options seem to overlap or conflict with others. After reading several blog posts and watching a few YouTube videos, I have settled on the approach outlined below.

### Node.js Modules

The following Node.js modules enable my desired formatting and linting:

* babel-eslint
* eslint
* eslint-config-airbnb
* eslint-config-prettier
* eslint-plugin-import
* eslint-plugin-prettier
* eslint-plugin-vue
* prettier

While I have not yet thoroughly explored the world of React, nor do I write React code with any frequency, I am leveraging the Airbnb style guide to support the linting activities. Their style guide seems to be held in high regard within the community.

I install the required modules per project via the following commands:

```bash
npm install -D eslint prettier
npm audit fix
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
npm install -D babel-eslint eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-plugin-vue
```

### VS Code Extensions

Now we must install the extensions that allow us to leverage the power of the modules within the editor. Install the following:

* [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/itemdetails?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
* [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
* [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur)

### Configurations

Now comes the hard parth - configuring all of this new software. My current approach configures the following:

* **Prettier** - Formats all files *except* PHP and Vue.js. (At the time of this writing, it technically cannot natively format PHP.)
* **ESLint** - Lints all JavaScript. Code formatting is disabled due to use of `eslint-config-prettier`.
* **Vetur** - Lints all Vue.js and formats code *using Prettier's engine*

That's right - Prettier is a first-party player when formatting most files and then its engine is used ESLint and Veture.
