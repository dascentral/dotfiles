## Personal Settings

I make the following customizations to the application settings:

### Desktop Application

* General > Uncheck “Show Evernote Helper in the menu bar"
* Clipper > Uncheck “Bounce the dock icon once”
* Clipper > Uncheck “Play a sound"
* Formatting > Change default font to Calibri 14pt - See below for details
* Formatting > Enable “Simplify formatting of pasted content”
* Formatting > Auto Format > Uncheck "Keyboard shortcuts automatically create lists, lines, and emojis"
* Context > Uncheck “Show Context"

### Evernote Clipper

* General > Notebook selection > Always start in "Articles"
* General > Default clip action > Always start in "Simplified article"
* General > After clip > Automatically close Clipper
* General > Related results > Uncheck
* General > PDF page button > Uncheck
* Shortcuts > Uncheck "Enable keyboard shortcuts"

## System Fonts

I like using Microsoft's "Calibri" font within Evernote. Microsoft packages its application fonts within the app bundle. They are not available by default to other macOS applications and will need to be added manually to Font Book. You can add the font files from within the app bundle.

* Browse to `/Applications`
* Right click on `Microsoft Word.app` and click "Show Package Contents"
* Browse to `/Contents/Resources/DFonts`
