# Microsoft Outlook

## Introduction

Microsoft Outlook is a personal information manager from Microsoft, available as a part of the Microsoft Office suite. Although often used mainly as an email application, it also includes a calendar, task manager, contact manager, note taking, journal, and web browsing.

Personally, I think the software is pretty poor but I still use it at work.

## Installation

*See your friendly, neighborhood IT department.*

## Settings

I make the following customizations to the application settings:

* Notifications & Sounds > Turn off Desktop alert
* Notifications & Sounds > Turn off all sounds
* Reading > Mark items read after previewing for 1 second
* Signatures > Add the signatures
* AutoCorrect > AutoFormat > Uncheck everything except "Internet and network paths with hyperlinks"
* Calendar > Set work starts to "8:00am"
* Calendar > Set work ends to "7:00pm"
