# Alfred

## Introduction

Alfred is a productivity application for macOS, which boosts your efficiency with hotkeys, keywords and text expansion. Search your Mac and the web, and control your Mac using custom actions with the Powerpack.

## Installation

[https://www.alfredapp.com/](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

## Settings

I use Alfred's [sync](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/advanced/sync/) functionality to sync settings across computers. However, some settings are not synced between computers. As a result, I make the following manual customizations:

* General > Set "Alfred Hotkey" to "Ctrl + Space"
* Features > 1Password > Click "Enabled 1Password Bookmarks"
* Appearance > Select "Alfred macOS" theme
