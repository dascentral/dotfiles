# PHP Coding Standards Fixer

## Introduction

> The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one. You can also define your (team's) style through configuration.

## Configuration

The `.php_cs` file within this folder represents the configuration file that I use across all projects. I configure each my IDE to reference the cloned repository location.
