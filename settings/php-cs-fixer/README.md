# PHP Coding Standards Fixer

## Introduction

> The PHP Coding Standards Fixer (PHP CS Fixer) tool fixes your code to follow standards; whether you want to follow PHP coding standards as defined in the PSR-1, PSR-2, etc., or other community driven ones like the Symfony one. You can also define your (team's) style through configuration.

## Settings

The `.php_cs` file within this folder represents the configuration file that I use across all of my projects.

In an effort to keep settings consistent across computers, I maintain a copy of this file within cloud-based storage and configure my IDE to reference the cloud location.


However, the file here still serves as a representation of the ruleset that I prefer to use.
