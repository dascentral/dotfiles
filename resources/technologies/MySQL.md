# MySQL

## Introduction

MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. [https://www.mysql.com/](https://www.mysql.com/).

## Data Management

### mysqldump

The following script will dump the provided database but it excludes the `CREATE DATABASE` statement.

```bash
mysqldump -u root databasename > databasename_dump.sql
```

## Constraints

### Adding FK Constraints

```sql
ALTER TABLE table1
ADD CONSTRAINT table1_column1 FOREIGN KEY (column1)
REFERENCES table2 (column2) ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### Unique Constraints

```sql
ALTER TABLE table1 ADD UNIQUE (column1);
```

## Triggers

### Set date on insert

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER table_date_created BEFORE INSERT ON table FOR EACH ROW set NEW.date_created = NOW();
```

### Update date on update

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER table_last_updated BEFORE UPDATE ON table FOR EACH ROW set NEW.last_updated = NOW();
```

## User Administration

All of the commands below should be run against the `mysql` database. You should execute a `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` for changes to take affect.

### Application Users

I recently began using MySQL 8.0 which has me using a new syntax for application users.

```sql
use mysql;
create user 'user'@'127.0.0.1' identified with mysql_native_password by 'password';
grant all privileges on `table`.* TO 'user'@'127.0.0.1';
flush privileges;
```

### Administrative Users

These statements will create a user that can do anything from anywhere. Be careful with these.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '[user]'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '[pass]' WITH GRANT OPTION;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO '[user]'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '[pass]' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

## Password Policy

**Show Policy**

```sql
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password%';
```

**Change Policy**

```sql
SET GLOBAL validate_password_policy=LOW;
```

## Table Modifications

**Alter column order**

Let's say you want to move a column to a different spot because you feel column order is really important (which it is). You essentially redefine the column and add an `after` clause.

```sql
ALTER TABLE payments MODIFY transaction_date date NOT NULL AFTER id;
```

## Legacy Content

I need to clean all of this up.



**Triggers**

**Mass Trigger Update**

1) Dump trigger definitions into a file

mysqldump -u root -p --triggers --add-drop-trigger --no-create-info --no-data --no-create-db --skip-opt test > ~/triggers.sql

2) Open triggers.sql file in your favorite editor and use Find and Replace feature to change DEFINERs. Save updated file.

3) Recreate triggers from the file

mysql < ~/triggers.sql

**Data Administration**

**Dump Full Database**

The following command will export a full database and will include the statements necessary to create the database. (CREATE DATABASE / USE dbname) This is the optimal command when backing up and restoring to the same database.

mysqldump -u [username] -p --databases databasename > databasename_dump.sql

 

**Dump Full Database - without CREATE DATABASE**

The following command will exclude those database creation directives. This is ideal when copying one database into another. (e.g. DEV to STAGE)

mysqldump -u [username] -p databasename > databasename_dump.sql

**Dump All Data**

Dump all data from all databases.

mysqldump -u dsmith -p --all-databases > full.sql

**Dump Table Data**

mysqldump -u root --no-create-info --skip-triggers --no-create-db [database] > ~/dump.sql

**Dump Data for Individual Table**

mysqldump -u root --no-create-info --skip-triggers --no-create-db [database] [table] > ~/dump.sql

**Restoring From a Data Dump**

Most mysqldump files contain the necessary DROP & CREATE DATABASE statements to start from scratch. The restore syntax from your backup file is as follows:

mysql --user=USER -p < ~/backup.sql

I am currently unclear if DB users previously created can access the new database created by this backup. If you maintain the database, the following syntax will restore to the appropriate database assuming you take out the DROP & CREATE statements...

mysql --user=USER -p DATABASE < ~/backup.sql

**Creating Table Structure Dump**

mysqldump -d -u username -p --databases databasename > ~/databasename_dump.sql

**sqlbackup**

sqlbackup is the backup utility I brought from Mindshare. It's nothing more than an abstraction for the mysqldump command. A cron entry would look like this...

**Backup Syntax**

5 2 * * * /sqlbackup/sqlbackup db user 'pwd' -d /sqlbackup/pools/ -z

**Restore Syntax**

mysql --user=[user] -p --database=[database] < [backup_file]

**Table Manipulation**

**Converting from utf8 to utf8mb4**

https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/mysql-utf8mb4

*# For each database:*

ALTER DATABASE database_name CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

*# For each table:*

ALTER TABLE table_name CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

*# For each column:*

*# (Donâ€™t blindly copy-paste this! The exact statement depends on the column type, maximum length, and other properties. The above line is just an example for a `VARCHAR` column.)*

ALTER TABLE table_name CHANGE column_name column_name VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

**Create UTF8 Database**

CREATE DATABASE dbname CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;

**Adding Columns**

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name INT(11) AFTER game_date;

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD date_created DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT '0000-00-00';

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD enabled TINYINT(1) UNSIGNED NOT NULL default '1';

ALTER TABLE table_name ADD column_name VARCHAR(255) AFTER column_name;

**Modify a Column**

ALTER TABLE contacts CHANGE name name VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL;

**Change Auto_Increment**

ALTER TABLE table AUTO_INCREMENT = xxx;

**Timezones**

**Source:** https://javorszky.co.uk/2016/06/06/today-i-learned-about-mysql-and-timezones/

**Primary Learning**

*What I learned today is that use of ET isn't necessarily "bad" as long as Ubuntu, PHP, MySQL, and Laravel are all set to ET or "America/New_York" timezones. Use of TIMESTAMP fields would allow for automatic translation to UTC. DATETIME fields would require manual manipulation.*

*If I were to setup a new server and deploy a new application, I would go with UTC as the timezone setting for all actors.*

**Relevant Timezones - As of April 2019**

- My timezone: UTC-4 (EDT)
- Server timezone: UTC-4 (EDT)
- MySQL timezone: UTC-4 (EDT)
- MySQL connection: ?? - I do not believe this is set
- PHP timezone: America/New_York (UTC-4)

**TIMESTAMP**

What I learned from the article above is that the TIMESTAMP field will (behind the scenes) store all values in UTC. However, data is displayed and queried in the server's timezone.

Query the current timezone setting via the following:

```sql
SELECT @@global.time_zone;
```

However, that is likely to show you "SYSTEM" which (I think) means it is pulling timezone information from the server. This command will show you the real value:

```sql
SELECT TIMEDIFF( now(), utc_timestamp() );
```

When you insert data into a timestamp field, it uses the timezone setting to convert to UTC for storage. So if you insert data in EDT and then change the server timezone, the value returned via query is in the NEW timezone.

So, the author contends (and I think I agree) that timezones are great when you need a fixed point in time AND your code/application knows dates are provided and retrieved in the local timezone of the system.

It is important to note that TIMESTAMP fields are stored as a 32-bit integer so they have a potentially limited range. The minimum value is 1970-01-01 00:00:00 and the maximum is 2038-01-19 03:14:07.

**DATETIME**

DATETIME fields do NOT store timezone information so what you put in is what you get out, regardless of server timezone settings.

The author contends (although not sure yet if I agree) that DATETIME fields are best when your application provides all dates in UTC. He hates on TIMESTAMP a bit for changing its response based upon TZ setting. I'm not sure I agree that's a "bad" thing.
