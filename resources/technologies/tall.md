# TALL Stack

## Overview

The "TALL Stack" represents a new way to build rich, reactive web applications.

* "T" is for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
* "A" is for [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine), a rugged, minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup.
* "L" is for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), a PHP web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
* "L" is for [Laravel Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/), a full-stack framework for Laravel that makes building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.

I have separate files for Tailwind CSS and Laravel. This document will cover Alpine.js and Livewire. They are very tightly intertwined and share the same author.

In addition to everything listed below, I recommend that you check out [Awesome TALL Stack](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/awesome-tall-stack).
