# Tailwind CSS

## Introduction

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke designs without any opinionated styles you have to fight to override.

## Education

The Tailwind CSS website lists a [series of screencasts](https://tailwindcss.com/screencasts/) that will show you a lot of what you need to know about how to use Tailwind CSS.

## Components & Templates

### TailwindUI

[Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) is a repository of "fully responsive HTML components, designed and developed by Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger." It is not free but I bought it, and it feels like it was worth every penny.

### Tailwind Toolbox

Open source starter templates and components, a plugins directory and useful tools/utilities to kick start your Tailwind CSS project. [https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/components/modal](https://www.tailwindtoolbox.com/components/modal)

### Workcation

Demo site created entirely with TailwindCSS by one of the framework's creators, Adam Wathan. [https://workcation.netlify.com/](https://workcation.netlify.com/)

### Alptail

Tailwind UI will be updated later this year to add interactivity via JavaScript. Until that happens, [Alptail](https://www.alptail.com/) serves as a collection of open source UI components, using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine).

## Linting

When it comes to formatting and linting code, I strive to always identify the command-line solution first. You never know what IDE a company or product team will be using so it feels irresponsible to focus on the IDE-centric solution first.

That being said, I haven't nailed my command-line setup for Tailwind CSS. :innocent: In the meantime, here are a few articles:
