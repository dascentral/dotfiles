# PHP

## PHP 8.0

* [PHP 8 Upgrade on Mac](https://stitcher.io/blog/php-8-upgrade-mac) â€” Includes how to handle Laravel Valet

## PHP 7.4

### Installation

```bash
brew install php@7.4
```

### PATH Issues

Following an upgrade to Mojave, I had some challenges getting PHP to work properly with [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/master/valet). Homebrew was letting me know that PHP is "keg-only" so you have two force creation of symlinks to get it working properly.

```bash
brew link php@7.4 --force
```

Alternatively, if you do not need the symlinks, you can simply add the `bin` and `sbin` folders to your system path:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.4/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/php@7.4/sbin:$PATH"
```

### Uninstall

```bash
brew services stop php
brew unlink php@7.4
brew uninstall php@7.4
```
